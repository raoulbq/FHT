A Fast Hermite Transform on the uniform grid

```FHT``` is a C program that computes a 1D or 2D Fast Hermite Transform.
The algorithm used is a modifcation of the 1995 work 
*Fast Discrete Polynomial Transforms with Applications to Data Analysis for distance transitive graphs*
by Driscoll, Healy, and Rockmore.
